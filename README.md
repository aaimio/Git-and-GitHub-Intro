# Goal of this repository

- **Creating your first pull request**, by adding your name to the `people` folder and opening a PR on GitHub.
- **Get a basic introduction to collaborating on GitHub**, through reviews from bots and your peers.

---

# The task

1. **Fork this repository to your own GitHub account**
   - If you're reading this on GitHub then there should be a **Fork** button at the top right of this page, click that button.
   - If you're reading this elsewhere, go to the URL of this repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone the repository**
   - You can do so by going to your terminal and writing the command below:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/Git-and-GitHub-Intro.git
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
$ npm install
```

4. **Add an empty file (without file extension) named after your GitHub username to the `people` folder (e.g. `torvalds`)**
   - **Protip**: Use the `touch` command in your terminal to create a new empty file.

```bash
$ touch people/<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

5. **Add the newly created file to your staging area**

```bash
$ git add .
```

6. **Commit the file to your local repository**

```bash
$ git commit -m "Adding my name to the repo"
```

7. **Create a pull request from your fork to this repository**
   - After creating a PR, the [github-actions[bot]](https://github.com/apps/github-actions) will review your PR immediately.
     - If the bot is happy, ask two of your peers to approve your pull request (this can be anyone).
     - If the bot is not happy, they will tell you what needs to be updated.
8. **Help your friends or wait for a couple minutes**. After the [github-actions[bot]](https://github.com/apps/github-actions) is happy with your PR, it will check every 5 minutes or so to check whether you've obtained enough approvals for your PR to be merged to `main`.
9. Everything is OK? Tell one of your mentors to merge your PR.
10. After a mentor has merged your PR, your name will be automatically assigned to a team.

  - `resources`
    - `magic.js`: A small React component that represents the elements we'll show to the user. It's included through a `text/babel` tag in `index.html` allowing us to use modern JS and React. If you want to change how the teams are presented you can do so here.
    - `styles.css`: Simple stylesheet to create a somewhat presentable team overview.
    - `teams.json`: Contains the teams that were generated in `create-teams` GitHub Action.
